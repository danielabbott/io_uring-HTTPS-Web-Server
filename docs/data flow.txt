write:
1. HTTP write (headers/data) ->
2. TLS write_tmp_buffer (unencrypted) ->
3. TLS BIO (encrypted) ->
	network (TCP)


2: Unencrypted buffer for combining small writes together. All writes go through the bufferedWrite function.
	Large sections of data skip the buffer.
	If TLSConnection.bufferedWrite does not fully write, the data MUST be attempted for writing again until it succeeds (unless the connection is closed).
	Partial writes are possible, in which case the remainder of the write must be retried.

3: Stores encrypted data while it is being sent over TCP
	





read:
1. TCPServer.zig read event (64KB buffers, encrypted) ->
2. HTTP callback (takes slice from 1.) ->
3. TLS read (takes slice from 2., decrypts data) ->
4. TLS read_buffer (decrypted)
